### Recreate required stls

To recreate the required STL-files, you can run `build.bat`. Please note, that OpensCAD needs to be installed in `%PROGRAMFILES%\OpenSCAD\openscad.exe`.

If you want to manually recreate the files, you need to open, render & export the following files in OpenSCAD:
- led_fixation_plate.scad
- led_holder_plate.scad
- backplate_wall.scad
- letter_plate.scad
