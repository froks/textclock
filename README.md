textclock
=========

textclock is a parametric 3d-printable textclock. It's currently in development.

It's designed to be used with a 60 led/m SK6812 led-strip, and a esp8266 (using micropython) for control.

The letterface is currently in German, but can be easily adapted to other languages.
