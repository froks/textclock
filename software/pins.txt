ESP8266:

In most cases only pins 0, 2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 can be used.

On my board:
Pin(0) = D3
Pin(2) = switches LED near antenna (low = led on)
Pin(4) = D2
Pin(5) = D1
Pin(12) = D6

sda = D2 = 4
scl = D1 = 5


import machine

i2c = machine.I2C(freq=100000,scl=machine.Pin(5), sda=machine.Pin(4))

import urtc

rtc = urtc.DS1307(i2c, 104)
